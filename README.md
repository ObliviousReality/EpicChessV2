# EpicChessV2
An early game experiment, made in C++ using SDL2. Code does not work out of the box as this was also my first project using Visual Studio 19 and I set up the environment badly, making git tracking hard.

For a write-up of the quality of the game, and my lessons learned from it, see https://obliviousreality.github.io/EpicChessV2.
